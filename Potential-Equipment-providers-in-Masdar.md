Research Interest
Dr. Ni’s research interests mainly focus on the effects of mechanical force on Cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Specifically, shear stress generated from blood flow plays an important role in the physiological or pathological function of endothelial cells, which composes the inner layer of blood vessels. Disturbed blood flow resulting in low and oscillatory shear stress leads to atherosclerosis and affects the progression of angiogenesis (new vessel formation). The ultimate goal of his research is to understand critical mechanisms which cause CVD and subsequently identify essential genes that will serve as major targets for drug discovery. Currently, he is utilizing Zebrafish as an animal model to screen vascular deficits associated with specific genes and will apply the entire approach to rodent study as well as human research in the near future.
