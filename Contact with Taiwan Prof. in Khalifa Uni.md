"The Second mail"

It depends. But the company usually set 4-6 weeks for delivery after receiving the PO.

I spend one year to establish my lab, and just try to have some research activity recently. FYI.

Talk to your professor, maybe he wants to visit our University or NYUAD, or UAEU to find potential collaborator to get something done while you are establishing your own system.
