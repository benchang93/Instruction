DNA Force Curve and Imaging (From http://www.asylumresearch.com/Products/Kits/ApplicationKitsDSHR.pdf)

• 2 bare mica slides 

  (I think we have this?)


• 1 DNA coated mica slide  

  (We will prepare)


• 5 ml of imaging buffer (5mM NiCl2, 40mM HEPES, pH 6.8 buffer)

  (ZJ told me Dr. Lina has HEPES buffer, I think we should contact her.)



• 3 silicon nitride cantilevers, Model TR400PB (use the short, 100µm long cantilever)



• 1ml of DNA solution (1ng/µl) in imaging buffer (Ni2+ buffer), ready to use.


  (DNA would be sent from Taiwan, plasmid DNA with 1ug/uL concentration in TE buffer)
   
  (Linear DNA 


• 50µl of DNA solution (100ng/µl) in a TE buffer. 

  This buffer will preserve the DNA molecules longer than if they were stored/diluted in the imaging buffer.



• 1 dessicant bag for storage
